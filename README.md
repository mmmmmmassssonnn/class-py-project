# Welcome to our project

This is a terminal-based programming project for our MIS class. 

This project is a coffee shop with ordering done in the terminal. It utilizes a menu done with JSON for easy updating and storing. It allows for discount codes and calculates the total with tax and discounts included.

Enjoy :)
